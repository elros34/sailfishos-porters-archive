 Very simple web application for searching the sailfish-porters IRC logs.

Add the local archive program from https://github.com/starkDbl07/sailfishIRC-localArchiver.git as a subfolder.

Posting a search query will grep the logs

A get request on a particular log will parse the log file and add bookmarks for each line
